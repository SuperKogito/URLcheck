# urlchecker-action

A GitHub action to collect and check URLs in a project (code and documentation).
The action aims at detecting and reporting broken links.

## How to use it?

A set of examples are included in the [examples](examples) folder. A few detailed 
examples are also included below. Note that examples always reference the master branch,
however you should change them to reference a [release](https://github.com/urlstechie/urlchecker-action/releases).

### Example with Checkout

For most use cases, you will want to use the git repository that is being checked
for a GitHub actions, and we do this by way of the [actions/checkout](https://github.com/actions/checkout) action.

```
name: Check URLs

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: urls-checker
      uses: urlstechie/urlchecker-action@master
      with:
        # A subfolder or path to navigate to in the present or cloned repository
        subfolder: docs

        # A comma-separated list of file types to cover in the URL checks
        file_types: .md,.py,.rst

        # Choose whether to include file with no URLs in the prints.
        print_all: false

        # The timeout seconds to provide to requests, defaults to 5 seconds
        timeout: 5

        # How many times to retry a failed request (each is logged, defaults to 1)
        retry_count: 3

        # A comma separated links to exclude during URL checks
        exclude_urls: https://github.com/SuperKogito/URLs-checker/issues/1,https://github.com/SuperKogito/URLs-checker/issues/2

        # A comma separated patterns to exclude during URL checks
        exclude_patterns: https://github.com/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues

        # choose if the force pass or not
        force_pass : true
```

Note that as of version 0.2.2, references to `white_listed_*` have been changed to
`exclude_*` to be consistent with the `include_*` variables.


### Example with Custom Clone

It could, however, be the case that you've set up a repository with one or more uses of the URLChecker
that must clone one or more repos (possibly with varying branches) before doing the check.
In this case, you might want to define `git_path` and `branch` for each section.
An example is below:

```
name: Check URLs

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: URLs-checker
      uses: urlstechie/urlchecker-action@master
      with:
        # A project to clone. If not provided, assumes already cloned in the present working directory.
        git_path: https://github.com/urlstechie/URLs-checker-test-repo

        # If a git_path is defined to clone, clone this branch (defaults to master)
        branch: devel

        # A subfolder or path to navigate to in the present or cloned repository
        subfolder: docs

        # Delete the cloned repository after running URLchecked (default is false)
        cleanup: true

        # A comma-separated list of file types to cover in the URL checks
        file_types: .md,.py,.rst

        # Choose whether to include file with no URLs in the prints.
        print_all: false

        # Choose whether to print a more verbose end summary with files and broken URLs.
        verbose: true

        # The timeout seconds to provide to requests, defaults to 5 seconds
        timeout: 5

        # How many times to retry a failed request (each is logged, defaults to 1)
        retry_count: 3

        # A comma separated links to exclude during URL checks
        exclude_urls: https://github.com/SuperKogito/URLs-checker/issues/1,https://github.com/SuperKogito/URLs-checker/issues/2

        # A comma separated patterns to exclude during URL checks
        exclude_patterns: https://github.com/SuperKogito/Voice-based-gender-recognition/issues

        # A comma separated list of file patterns (direct paths work as well) to exclude
        exclude_files: README.md,/github/workspace/_config.yml

        # numbers of workers to run in parallel (defaults to 9 if unset)
        workers: 4

        # choose if the force pass or not
        force_pass: true

        # save the results to a file
        save: results.csv

        # The results format saved to a file. Supported: 'csv' or 'sarif'. Default is csv
        format: csv 
```

## Details

### Hidden File Types

If you need to specify a file_types pattern to include hidden files, you'll need a `.*` pattern that is provided in the context of a comma separated list, for example:

```yaml
file_types: '.*,'
```
If there is another pattern or variable specification that you'd like to see an example of here, please [open an issue](https://github.com/urlstechie/urlchecker-action/issues).
